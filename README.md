# Crunch-Time
## Developed By: Keifer, Marta, Rizzel, Mayuran, Nayandeep 

#### Description:
Crunch Time is an exercise app for people with little time. The user inputs how much time they have and the app provides them an exercise to do while displaying motivational quotes. The app then records your time, exercises and name and records in a history setting.

#### Motivation: 
As gyms reopen with limited time available to workout, this app will serve to provide organized and intense workouts within a given time and also be able to target specific muscles to work on. This app is also for individuals who have limited time to workout and do not know what exercises to do with their available time. Building this app will help people to get motivated to squeeze in a few minutes of workout in their own busy schedule despite not going to the gym. Short 10 or 15 minutes of exercises can add up and give health benefits to people.
